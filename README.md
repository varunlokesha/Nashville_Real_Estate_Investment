# Nashville Real Estate Investment Using Logistic Regression, Descision tree, Random Forest & Gradient Boosting Algorithms

The exercise aims to effectively code and build a variety of classification models using logistic regression, decision tree model, random forest model, and gradient boosting model to predict whether properties in the Nashville area are being undervalued or overvalued. Steps include

•	Performing cleaning operations & feature engineering to prepare data for modelling.

•	Use the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithms to predict whether properties in the Nashville area are undervalued or overvalued.  

•	Interpret the results and comment on the accuracy of the model and compare all models using different performance metrics.

## Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering 
---

Null Value Check, Outlier Check, Checking the categorical feature balance/distribution were some of the data cleaning tasks. 

For Exploratory Data Analysis, The features were closely studies and various plots were used to understand how the features were correlated.

## Modelling
---

Each Model were built after various data preprocessing steps like encoding, scaling, feature engineering.

Also Hyperparameter tuning was used to establish optimal number of nodes, estimators and other parameters for building optimum models.

Based on the comparison table comparing important metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and AUC, it can be seen that gradient boosting has the highest accuracy along with having a better precision rate which indicates the accuracy of positive predictions. Also, the AUC of gradient boosting is the highest which signifies that it is a better classifier overall. Hence based on these 3 key metrics gradient boosting model is recommended to be used by the real estate company.
